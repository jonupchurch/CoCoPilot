# Changelog

All notable changes to Spec-Kit Mission Control are recorded here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/);
this project is pre-release and not yet versioned.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Spec-Kit + ai-tools scaffolding.** Copied the portable toolkit from
  `../ai-tools` per its bootstrap instructions: `.specify/` (Spec-Kit engine —
  templates + PowerShell automation), `.claude/` (the `speckit-*` skills, the
  `codebase-scout` / `verifier` / `diff-reviewer` subagents, the `/orient`,
  `/mini-spec`, `/verify`, `/commit`, `/pr` commands, and the read-only
  permission allowlist), `stacks/README.md`, `docs/interview-cheat-sheet.md`,
  and the `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `MANIFEST.md` operating context. The
  upstream `stacks/nextjs.md` pack was dropped — no stack is locked in yet.
- `.gitignore` — deliberately does **not** ignore `specs/` or
  `.specify/feature.json`. In the source `ai-tools` repo those are ignored
  because it ships the engine without project state; here they are the
  project's own tracked state.
- `CHANGELOG.md` and `STATUS.md`.
- Git repository initialized (`main`) and pushed to GitHub.

### Changed

- `CLAUDE.md` — added a "What this project is" section (brief, design-doc
  location, prior design output, the fact that the stack is still undecided)
  and reframed the toolkit section as *carried in from* `../ai-tools` rather
  than *shipped by* this repo. `AGENTS.md` and `MANIFEST.md` are kept verbatim
  so they stay in sync with upstream.

### Notes

- Engine verified in place: `create-new-feature.ps1 -DryRun` resolves the repo
  root to `D:\Codelib\skmc`, all four templates resolve to `.specify/templates/`,
  and commands format as `/speckit-<name>` (hyphen separator, per
  `.specify/integration.json`).
- No implementation code yet — per `designprompt.md` this is a design-first
  project. See [STATUS.md](STATUS.md).
